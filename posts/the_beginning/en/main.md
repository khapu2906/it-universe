# The Emergence of Computer Science
> *Many people might think that the beginning of computer science involves the use of the binary system 0,1 proposed by mathematicians such as Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz and George Boole, and they might be correct. However, the initial use of the binary system was for Mathematics - a fundamental field of study, so I will not delve into it in this article but focus on the field of computer science instead.*

### Historical Context
In the 1940s and 1950s, the world was engulfed in a social environment of tension and turmoil due to the global conflict of World War II. Every day, dangerous developments unfolded, profoundly impacting all aspects of life, from individuals to the economy, society, and culture of nations worldwide.

In this context, the need for computation and data analysis became more imperative than ever. Nations required powerful tools to decipher military messages, compute the positions and routes of armies, predict enemy movements and strategies. Additionally, resource management, production, and financial management posed significant challenges, necessitating support from computational tools and machinery.

In such dire circumstances, the emergence of electronic computers became indispensable. These machines not only provided rapid and accurate computation and data analysis but also optimized workflow, enhancing human capability and computational power. Therefore, in the challenging and tense backdrop of the 1940s and 1950s, the birth and development of electronic computers played a crucial, even decisive role in meeting the demands and challenges of the era.

By the 1940s and 1950s, the process of manufacturing and operating early electronic computers was challenging, requiring creativity and advanced technical knowledge. Computers like ENIAC and Colossus were built from basic components and utilized the emerging electronic technologies of the time.

- **Creators:** John Mauchly and J. Presper Eckert, known as the minds behind ENIAC's development. John Mauchly and J. Presper Eckert were two renowned computer engineers at the University of Pennsylvania. They received a contract from the U.S. Army during World War II to develop an electronic computer capable of rapidly performing complex calculations. ENIAC became the world's first commercial computer, laying the foundation for the computer industry's development.
- **Physical Structure:** ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer) was large and heavy, with over 17,000 vacuum tubes, thousands of relays, and complex mechanical components.
- **Operating Principle:** ENIAC operated based on the principles of electronic processors and basic logic circuits. Electric currents were controlled through vacuum tubes to perform calculations and data processing.
- **Operation with ENIAC:**

    - *Programming:* ENIAC lacked the ability to store programs like modern computers. Instead, operators had to manually connect wires to configure the machine for each specific task.
    - *Configuration:* Once the program was configured, operators had to set switches and connect wires for the specific calculations ENIAC needed to perform.
    - *Execution of Calculations:* With the settings in place, ENIAC would execute calculations based on the data and commands provided through controlling electric currents through vacuum tubes and basic logic circuits.
    - *Recording Results:* The results of calculations would be recorded through output mechanisms, such as lights or printers, for further use or reporting.

- **Military Applications:** ENIAC was initially developed to assist in computing artillery firing tables and ballistic charts for the U.S. military during World War II. This computer helped optimize calculation processes and reduce the time needed to compute crucial military parameters, thus aiding in more effective strategic decisions.

**Colossus:**

- **Creator:** Tommy Flowers, a British electronics engineer. He spent many years working in computer and telecommunications research before joining the Colossus project. Flowers' task was to design and build complex electronic components for Colossus, helping the computer become a vital tool in deciphering Germany's military messages during World War II.
- **Physical Structure:** Colossus was a massive digital computer, with hundreds of electronic control valves and various mechanical parts.
- **Operating Principle:** Colossus was designed to analyze and decrypt messages transmitted through tapes, using electronic control valves to perform basic logic operations.
- **Operation with Colossus:**

    - *Configuration and Startup:* Colossus was configured and started to perform a series of specific logic operations related to decrypting encoded messages from the Enigma machine.
    - *Data Reading:* Colossus would read data from tapes or other sources containing encoded messages.
    - *Data Analysis:* The read data would be analyzed and processed through basic logic operations to decrypt the encoded messages.
    - *Recording Results:* The results of the decryption process would be recorded for intelligence purposes or for further analysis steps.

- **Message Decryption:** Colossus was used in decrypting and analyzing encrypted messages of the German Reich during World War II. This computer played a significant role in decrypting messages from the German Enigma machines, improving the Allied intelligence operations and greatly influencing the outcome of the war.

Both of these computers operated on the principles of the first electronic computers: using electronic circuits and controlling electric currents to perform calculations and data processing. Although they had limitations in size, speed, and storage capacity compared to modern computers, ENIAC and Colossus laid the foundation for the remarkable development of the computer industry in the following decades.

> **Trivia:**
> Before the emergence of ENIAC and Colossus, several other computers were developed, but they were often small-scale devices and lacked the ability to perform complex calculations like these two computers.
> A notable example is the Harvard Mark I computer, one of the earliest electronic computers developed. Built at Harvard University under the direction of Howard Aiken and completed in 1944, Harvard Mark I was a large electromechanical computer, using mechanical gears to perform calculations. While not a fully electronic computer, Harvard Mark I marked a significant advancement in using machinery to perform complex calculations.
> Additionally, Konrad Zuse's Z3 computer, completed in 1941, was also one of the world's earliest electronic computers. Z3 is considered the first fully functional electronic computer capable of performing calculations using a combination of mechanical and electronic structures. Although primarily used for research purposes, Z3 had little practical impact on real-world applications.
